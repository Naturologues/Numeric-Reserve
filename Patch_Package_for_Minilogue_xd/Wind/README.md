# Wind

Wind is a subtractive synthesis oscillator wich works with five resonant filters, that move randomly on the spectrum.
Use the knob A to adjust the range of motion of the wind, and the knob B to adjust the pitch resonance of the exact key you're playing. When A is set on 0, the random motion and the range of movement of the wind is maximal, while if set to 1, the wind will turn out not to move at all. The variation of the knob can take a while to take effect, because the wind will finish his initial motion before move on to the next move.
Knob B can be used to switch from an atmospheric synthesizer to a melodic synthesizer easily.

Note that the ADSR envelope and all the options of the Korg synthesizer can always be used to adjust the sound of the patch to your use.
