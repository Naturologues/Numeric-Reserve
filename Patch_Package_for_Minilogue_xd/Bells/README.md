# Bells

Bells is an additive synthesis oscillator, with an amplitude and frequencies modulation options.
Use the knob A to adjust the modulation depth, and the knob B to adjust the modulation speed.
However, no sound variation will be audible if the knob B is set on 0. When the knob A is greater than 0, you can play adjust the modulation flutter with knob B.

You may hear some saturation depending on the values of the two parameters ; in that event, moving one of the knob may fix the problem.

Note that the ADSR envelope and all the options of the Korg synthesizer can always be used to adjust the sound of the patch to your use.
