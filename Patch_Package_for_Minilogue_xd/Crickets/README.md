# Crickets

Crickets is a filter source model oscillator that can simulate insect sounds. 
Use the knob A to adjust the pitch resonance, wich works more or less like a KBD slide, and knob B to adjust both the shape and the speed of the pulse.
In initial configuration (A to 0, B to 0), the patch will sound like a cricket. Know that if the knob A is set to 0, any key on the keyboard will play the same note.

Note that the ADSR envelope and all the options of the Korg synthesizer can always be used to adjust the sound of the patch to your use.
