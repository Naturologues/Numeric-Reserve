# Bells

Bells is an additive synthesis oscillator, with an amplitude and frequencies modulation options.
Use the knob A to adjust the modulation depth, and the knob B to adjust the modulation speed.
However, no sound variation will be audible if the knob B is set on 0. When the knob A is greater than 0, you can play adjust the modulation flutter with knob B.

You may hear some saturation depending on the values of the two parameters ; in that event, moving one of the knob may fix the problem.

# Wind

Wind is a subtractive synthesis oscillator wich works with five resonant filters, that move randomly on the spectrum.
Use the knob A to adjust the range of motion of the wind, and the knob B to adjust the pitch resonance of the exact key you're playing. When A is set on 0, the random motion and the range of movement of the wind is maximal, while if set to 1, the wind will turn out not to move at all. The variation of the knob can take a while to take effect, because the wind will finish his initial motion before move on to the next move.
Knob B can be used to switch from an atmospheric synthesizer to a melodic synthesizer easily.

# Crickets

Crickets is a filter source model oscillator that can simulate insect sounds. 
Use the knob A to adjust the pitch resonance, wich works more or less like a KBD slide, and knob B to adjust both the shape and the speed of the pulse.
In initial configuration (A to 0, B to 0), the patch will sound like a cricket. Know that if the knob A is set to 0, any key on the keyboard will play the same note.

# Clock

Clock is an impulse additive synthesis oscillator. 
Use the knob A to adjust the pulse velocity, and the knob B to randomly attribute pitch frequencies to pulse.
When the knob A is setup to 0, the rate of the pulse is of 60 ms, while if the knob is setup to 1, the pulse rate will be of 2000 ms.
Moving the knob B at high speed while the A parameter is at high rate can sound like water and produce some interesting results.
The key pressed on the keyboard has no influence on the sound of the synthesizer.

Note that the ADSR envelope and all the options of the Korg synthesizer can always be used to adjust the sound of the patch to your use.
