# Clock

Clock is an impulse additive synthesis oscillator. 
Use the knob A to adjust the pulse velocity, and the knob B to randomly attribute pitch frequencies to pulse.
When the knob A is setup to 0, the rate of the pulse is of 60 ms, while if the knob is setup to 1, the pulse rate will be of 2000 ms.
Moving the knob B at high speed while the A parameter is at high rate can sound like water and produce some interesting results.
The key pressed on the keyboard has no influence on the sound of the synthesizer.

Note that the ADSR envelope and all the options of the Korg synthesizer can always be used to adjust the sound of the patch to your use.
