# Numeric-Reserve # 1
We provide here our numeric patches inspired by everyday sounds for the Korg Nutekt NTS-1 and Minilogue xd digital synthesizers. 
Youâ€™ll find information about the code used in the logue SDK, the maxMSP / PureData patches used for the prototype sounds.

## Features
- 4 Oscillators inspired by daily sounds, available for the NTS-1 and the Minilogue xd
- User Manuals for each oscillator
- The Source Code of each oscillator
- The equivalent of our oscillators translated into patches for MaxMSP and Max for Live
