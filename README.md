# Numeric-Reserve # 1
We provide here our numeric patches inspired by everyday sounds for the Korg Nutekt NTS-1 and Minilogue xd digital synthesizers. 
Youâ€™ll find information about the code used in the logue SDK, the oscillators translated into MaxMSP patches, and some information about how to use our patches.

## Features
- 4 Oscillators inspired by daily sounds, available for the NTS-1 and the Minilogue xd
- User Manuals for each oscillator
- The Source Code of each oscillator
- The equivalent of our oscillators translated into patches for MaxMSP and Max for Live

## How to install
 - Install and launch the NTS-1 digital librarian (https://www.korg.com/us/support/download/software/0/832/4424/) (or the Minilogue xd librarian [https://www.korg.com/us/support/download/software/0/811/4222/])
 - Connect your NTS-1 to computer
 - Make sure to select the correct MIDI In and MIDI Out ports in the librarian preferences
 - Go to FILE -> IMPORT USER UNIT
 - Import the .ntkdigunit file (or the .mnlgxdunit if you're using the Minilogue xd)
 - Click on SEND ALL to get the patches you've imported on your hardware

## How to setup the Logue SDK (for environment development)
You can find all the informations you need on the logue SDK official Github (https://github.com/korginc/logue-sdk). Here are some other links that may help you to setup the environment :
